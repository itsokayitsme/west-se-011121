### How do I make a new rails app?

### How do I use rails generators 
#### DO NOT USE
```
rails generate scaffold 
```
- this will do everything for you and you are not allowed to use it until after phase-2, you must first learn how rails works, it generates a lot of files you don't need or know how to use yet so it's very obvious when you use it. **It is forbidden on the Code  Challenges and Projects**

#### DO USE

```
rails g model NameOfModel column_name:datatype column_name2:datatype2
```
- will create model and migration
```
rails g controller name_of_controller
```
- will create a controller and associated views
```
rails g migration add_new_column_name_to_table_name column_name:datatype 
```
- adds a new column
```
rails g migration remove_column_name_from_table_name column_name:datatype
```
- removes a column

```
rails g resource ModelName column_name:datatype column_name2:datatype2
```
- will create model, controller, views and routes

### Routes 
```
#method 'route', to: 'controller#action'
get '/candy_stores', to: 'candy_stores#show'

```
- custom route
```
#method 'route', to: 'controller#action', as: 'prefix'
get '/candy_stores', to: 'candy_stores#show', as: 'candy'
```
- to draw a single route _and_ create a path helper (e.g. candy_path)
```
#resources :model_name 
resources :candy_stores
```
- all routes 
```
resources :model_name. only: [:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update, :delete, :destroy]
resources( :candy_stores, {only: [:index]})
```
- specific routes (use this one)

# HTTP Request Response Cycle through a Rails app

client (browser) -> HTTP request -> routes.rb -> controller/action -> model -> db
db -> model -> controller -> view -> HTTP response -> client
